# Future language candidates for AoC

## Up next

- `Elixir`
- `OCaml`
- `Clojure`
- `Odin`

# Keep an eye on

- `Gleam`   BEAM language, [labeled arguments](https://erikarow.land/notes/gleam-syntax) 
- `Noulith` Custom made for AoC
- `Austral` Linear types
- `Vale`    Memory regions, higher order RAII
- `Hylo`    Mutable value semantics
- `Tao`     Early days functional lang
- `Roc`     Another Haskell competitor
- `Flix`    Effect system, regions to allow mutability inside pure functions
- `Koka`    Effect types 
- `Pony`    Compile time type, memory, and thread safety. Reference Capabilites.
- `Borgo`   Go, but removing all those stupid decisions I didn't like.

## One-offs

- `APL`      Array programming
- `Assembly` What's going on under the hood
- `Prolog`   Logic programming
- `Idris`    Dependent types
