# Future language candidates for AoC

## Interesting
Fun languages to try for new ideas / concepts.

- `Pony`    Compile time type, memory, and thread safety. Reference Capabilites.
- `Clojure` Lisp-y
- `Vale`    Memory regions, higher order RAII
- `Tao`     Early days functional lang
- `Koka`    Effect types 


## Industry standards
Languages with wide adoption.  
Fewer unique concepts to learn, but good to build some familiarity with.

- `Ruby/Crystal` Design philosophy focused on developer UX could be interesting
- `Java`         Not many code samples on Github. Not much outside of streams seems to be all that new
- `Swift`        Tied to the Apple ecosystem? 
- `Go`           Solid adoption. 


## Unlikely
Some more niche languages, unlikely to be used for a full 25 day AoC challenge.

- `APL`      Extremely concise formulas
- `Assembly` What's going on under the hood
- `Prolog`   Logic programming
- `Idris`    Dependent types
